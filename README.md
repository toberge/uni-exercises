# uni-ecercises
Various exercises from university courses  
Totally qualified solutions as usual /s

**TDAT1003** was the introductory programming course (Java)  
**TDAT1005** was its sequel (Java, SQL)

Since this is the last time these versions of the courses are run, I assume it is fine to make my solutions publicly available  
\- there should no longer be a risk of somebody using my code to cheat their way through their education.
