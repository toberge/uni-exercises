# uni-ecercises
Various exercises from university courses  
Totally qualified solutions as usual /s

**TDAT1003** was the introductory programming course (Java)  
**TDAT1005** was its sequel (Java, SQL)

### Please keep the following in mind:
+ Some of the code is not written by me; the exercises often have premade code we are supposed to use. Those pieces should stick out as relatively simple compared to the rest of the exercise.
+ The code I've written is of variable quality, and may contain errors or otherwise have failed to do as required. Most of it should behave correctly.

Since this is the last time these versions of the courses are run, I assume it is fine to make my solutions publicly available  
\- there should no longer be a risk of somebody using my code to cheat their way through their education.
